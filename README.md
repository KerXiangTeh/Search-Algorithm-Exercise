    - Implement Uninformed & Informed searching strategies
    - Apply different searching strategies for the given problem
    - Analyze and Compare the searching strategies

In this exercise, I will focus on python file reading, graph creation, 
and implementation of various search algortihms (BFS, UCS, Greedy Best First Search, and A* Search).
